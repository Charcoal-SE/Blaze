Blaze
=====
[Blaze](https://charcoal-se.org/blaze/) is a web application that displays recent content (answers, questions and comments) on a Stack Exchange site. You can use it to check for potential low-quality content on sites.

To get started, enter a site name in the textbox (such as `stackoverflow`, `softwarerecs`, ...) and you'll get a list of recent answers/questions/comments.

If you use the "Authenticate" link at the top of the page, you can give Blaze access to flag a post on the site itself; a "flag on site" link will appear. When clicking on that one, you get a dialog for the flag reasons. When you select one, Blaze will flag the post on the site through your Stack Exchange account.
